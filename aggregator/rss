 <title>Jody Zivtech Feed: Use CCK link and filefields as redirects to legacy content</title>
 <link>http://www.zivtech.com/blog/use-cck-link-and-filefields-redirects-legacy-content</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;We&#039;re working on a project with too much non-uniform legacy HTML to migrate it all into Drupal. Some of it we&#039;re handling by migrating certain data into nodes and dumping the entire HTML content into the node body so it can be easily indexed by Solr for search and the titles can be included in other views listings.&lt;/p&gt;
